# Problem 2

## one trial

``` r
n     = 30
sigma = 5
alpha = 0.05
mu_grid = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)

one_trial = function(mu) {
  x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)

  tibble(
    mu_hat   = unname(tt$estimate),  
    p_value  = tt$p.value
  )
}
```

## Run 5000 simulations for each mu

``` r
sim_p2 = expand_grid(mu_true = mu_grid, iter = 1:5000) |>
  mutate(res = map(mu_true, one_trial)) |>

## Compute power and visualize

- **Is the sample average of 𝜇̂ across tests for which the null is
  rejected approximately equal to the true value of 𝜇? Why or why not?**

No, the sample average of 𝜇̂ among rejected tests is not equal to the
true value of 𝜇. As shown in the second plot, the blue line (significant
results) is higher than the red line for small and moderate true means,
indicating an upward bias. This occurs because only extreme sample means
tend to be significant. As the true mean increases and power approaches
1, this bias becomes smaller.
