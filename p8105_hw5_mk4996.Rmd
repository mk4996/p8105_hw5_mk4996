* **Is the sample average of 𝜇̂ across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the true value of 𝜇? Why or why not?**

No, the sample average of 𝜇̂ among rejected tests is not equal to the true value of 𝜇.
As shown in the second plot, the blue line (significant results) is higher than the red line for small and moderate true means, indicating an upward bias.
This occurs because only extreme sample means tend to be significant.
As the true mean increases and power approaches 1, this bias becomes smaller.

```

* **Comment**

The plot shows the estimated proportions of unsolved homicides with 95% confidence intervals for each city.
There is substantial variation across cities, for example, Baltimore, MD and Chicago, IL have some of the highest proportions of unsolved cases, while Richmond, VA and Tulsa, AL have the lowest.
Cities with small numbers of total homicides, such as Tulsa, show extremely wide confidence intervals that extend across most of the range (0–1), reflecting the instability of estimates based on small samples.
Overall, the results highlight large disparities in homicide case resolution rates across U.S. cities.
